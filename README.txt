WildWork by Team RACK

Summary of Pages:

-home: Ideally, this page will introduce WildWork and have an animation leading to the main screen, where users will begin Representative Task 1.

-main: This page displays date and time (in real time), still need to update date. 

-tasks: This page is where users can enter their tasks. Ideally, + button will change editable content of subsequent task (ul element)

What Needs to Be Built: 

@Kya
-designtasks: page where users customize tasks (e.g., due date, task type, and completeness)
After designing tasks, tasks (ul elements in list) should be cached as global variables, to then add to main page with an Added To-Do List (table view)

@Kya
-todolist: Similar to the main page, with the list of all the tasks the user entered at the bottom left of the screen (use table constructed for designtasks - not too much work for this UI)

@Kap
-task_running: Also modeled off of main page, with top right of screen displays "Current Task" (use global variables of task names, which weâ€™ll need to extern from other js files, to design rounded corner circle)

@Cori
-task_eval: For users to complete 3rd representative task, the "How did it go?" page will allow users to input completeness with slide bar, time spent, and chief distractions will be displayed (static in beginning - later iterations should somehow scrape from browser history?)
